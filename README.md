## 1. Introduction

Test Your Spanish Site is designed for beginner levels srudents of Spanish language, and general public, who wish to test their knowledge of basis Spanish Nouns.

## 2. User Experience (UX)

I have attampted to create an uncluttered and responsive site with a very simple and clean index page where the main feature is an inviting background and an easy access to the ten question (each with four possible answer options)quiz.
The color scheme lends iteself to the Spanish feel.
Buttons allow user to easily check their answers and reload the page if they wish to re-try quiz.
The total score gives an indication of fraction of correct answers versus the total possible score.

- **The header:**
    * Gives a clear indication of concept of the quiz.
    has a spanish themed picture in the background, in tune with spanish theme ethos;

*   **HMain body:**
    * Has a central list of ten questions with various spanish nouns, each giving a clickable option of four radio button format answer choises
    * At the bottom of question list there is a button to Submit All the answers, upon which, the score results with brief message appear
    * The user then have a choice to press another, reload button, to re-try the same quiz.

## 3. Wireframe

The wireframe was designed using Balsamiq.
It has a basic intial structure, which remained throughout the project, with the styling slightly changed/enchanced for better viewing experience.

Below is a link to all my wireframes:

## 4. Visual Identity

 For this site, I wanted to use a simple word format in a classical font, to make it universal and appealing.

 I have used mainly combination of warm mediteranean colors and grey, to enchance Spanish theme, contunuity, seperate sections and to keep it uniform.
 
 The font colors and background colors are interchangebale as you scroll down the page to the buttons, to keep more appealing and easier on the eye to the user, as opposed to variety new colors being introduced.

 The Buttons change color on a click to keep it uniform and to give predictability for user.

 The Submit Button blends in with the background of the main page after click, to indicate that the quiz has finished and user should look out for the score.

 The Little message about the scores after submission gives a cheerful indication of how well user has done on that occasion.

 The footer has contact us link which re-directs to email on click, saving the user having to copy and paste.

## 7. Testing & Code Validation

************
*************
My website has been tested through the GTMetrix site,   
[GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com "GTmetrix Homepage")
Below is a screenshot of the results achieved, with performance and structure graded A by GTmetrix.

![GitHub Responsive](assets/images/gtmetrix-el.jpg)

I have tested the site on a number of occasions throughout the building process, so that I could see it from different devices such as my mobile, tablet and PC and check for responsiveness.

The site was tested on CSS and HTML Validator sites. There were some syntax mistakes, missed characters etc, that have been updated.

### **Issues and Changes Implemented**

During this testing I realised that I had to make some design changes to areas that I was not satisfied with, to make it more easy to navigate, user firendly and improve the viewing experience on the mobile devices.
I have therefore made many changes as I went along in order to make it more responsive or easier to navigate. Some of these changes are listed below:
* Initially Index Page had just navigation link listed at the top and hero image, followed by footer. I have added the central To Cakes call of action button to make it easier to reach the product page.
* The Header was not responsive enough on mobile devices so I have used pure CSS code to make nav bar more responsive.
* The Header components were aligned to the sides of the screen to start with, but were centered to make it more appealing from UX point of view.
* The Index page background image and call of action button were initially set as separate divs and would overlap when tested on different screen sizes. This was overcome by using bootstrap jumbotron.
* The footer was changed from original p style into unordered list to make it more readable on different devices.
* The Order section was found to not fit into smaller screens properly, adding some padding have corrected it.
* Some of the background colors (on Index and Order pages) have needed adjusting to make the text displayed over them more easy to read.
* While testing I realised few links were not working where I have mistyped addresses, those were rectified.
* About Us page sections where not aligning properly on different size screens, I have added a flex grid to overcome that issue. It has also appeared to have too long paragraphs to keep visitor interested, which were concentrated and shortened since.
* Having noticed that images overstretch horizontally on larger screens, max-width has been added to each page main section to resolve this.

*Changes I would still like to add:*
* *Setting buttons on Cakes page to be at the same line of viewing. I have tried different styling and html structures but havent managed yet to achieve it.*
* *Improving Order Form, to have an option of adding things to basket, continue to the payment page etc.*

**As a User I was able to:**
* See contact information clearly either straight away at the bottom of page or by scrolling down on smaller devices 
* Be taken to the product page by clicking on central button in Home page
* See images of products and click on 'Order' link from Cakes page
* Get basic information about business ethos from AboutUs page accesible from top nav bar
* Access company's social media accounts from footer on each page.
* Contact business by email or phone by clicking a relevant field in footer and not having to type text/numbers in.
* Forward order and any comments/enquiries by clicking on Order tab in Nav Links and filling Order form.
